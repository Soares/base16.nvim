# Base16 color schemes for nvim

Install with something like Plug:

    Plug 'Soares/base16.nvim'

The main features of these color schemes are:

1. They distinguish between "changing which red red is" and "changing which
   things show up as red". Each color scheme is based off of vim's default
   color scheme, but with the colors set to nicer base16 colors. Configuration
   options let you change which types of objects are which types of colors.
2. They set all the `g:terminal_color_*` variables, which makes the terminal
   emulator in neovim use a matching colorscheme.

Install this plugin in the usual way (with vim-plug or vundle or whatever). You
will need to either `set termguicolors=1` or use something like
[base16 shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) to set your
terminal colors to your preferred base16 color scheme.

To change what type of things show up as which color, you can configure with
commands such as

    let g:base16_color_modifiers = {'Comment': 'fg=green'}

which makes comments green (instead of vim's default blue). You can use the
special colors

    base similar3 similar2 similar1 contrast1 contrast2 contrast3 antibase

which range from black to white if `background` is `dark`, and from white to
black if `background` is `light`.

To use a transparent background (allowing you to take advantage of terminal
transparency and/or terminal background images), set

    let g:base16_transparent_background = 1

When you're ready, use a colorscheme of your choice:

    :set background=dark
    :colorscheme summerfruit

You're welcome to change colorschemes on the fly. For more info, see

    :help base16

It's also easy to make your own base16 color scheme, see the `schemes/`
directory for details. Basically, all you need to do is make a yaml file with
16 hex values in it. For reference, the order is:

    black dark3 dark2 dark1 light1 light2 light3 white
    red orange yellow green aqua blue purple brown

If you change the templates or add schemes, run `python buildall.py` to
generate all the pretty new color files. You'll need
[base16-builder](https://github.com/base16-builder/base16-builder) installed.
