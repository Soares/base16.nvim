" Base16 Apathy (https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)
" Scheme: Jannik Siebert (https://github.com/janniks)
" Neovim template: Nate Soares (http://so8r.es)

" The main ideas of this template are as follows:
" 1. Expose the available colors via g:base16_hex_colors and
"    g:base16_cterm_colors.
" 2. Use the default vim color allocation. In other words, compared to the
"    default vim theme, using this theme should change which red, blue, and
"    green you see, but it should not change which things appear red vs blue
"    vs green.
" 3. Expose a g:base16_color_overrides parameter so that you *can* change
"    which things appear red vs blue vs green, in such a way that if you
"    change themes mid-flight then your customizations get re-applied.
" 4. Expose a Base16Highlight command that you can use in case the above
"    parameters are not enough for you.
" 5. Expose a g:base16_transparent_background option in case you want vim to
"    let the terminal set the background (e.g., if your terminal has
"    a transparent background or a background image).

" Boilerplate: clear existing highlighting, reset the syntax, etc.
highlight clear
if exists('syntax_on')
  syntax reset

" Tell them our name.

" The Color Dictionary -------------------------------------------------------
" You may use this global dictionary to access your 16 colors.
" If you don't want it, you can always |:unlet| it after |:colorscheme|.
" In addition to these 16 colors, you'll also have relative colors which link
" to the light/dark greys differently depending on &background. See below.
"
" dark3 is the darkest grey; light3 is the lightest grey.

" Higher numbers are more extreme. So similar3 is most similar to base, and
" contrast3 is most similar to antibase.

" The Base16Highlight Command ------------------------------------------------
" We have to define this in the color file (instead of in a plugin/ file)
" because the colorscheme may well be run before plugins have loaded. We do
" outsource most of the work to an autoload function, though.
"
" TODO: Implement completion.  It would be nice to complete highlight groups,
" and attributes, and base16 colors.
command! -bang -nargs=+ Base16Highlight call base16#highlight(<q-bang>=='!', <f-args>)


" The Color Specifications ---------------------------------------------------
" Our colors are more-or-less the style that you get if you do |:hi clear|.
" In other words, by default, the base16 theme will change whwich
" yellow/red/etc you're seeing, but not which things are yellow vs red.
"
" There are a few exceptions to this rule.
" 1. When it comes to UI components (like the status line and the cursor
"    line), this theme does a bit of work to make everything look nice. In
"    this regard, the theme here is built off of the original solarized theme,
"    which I think did a pretty good job at this. (This is a finickey task.)
" 2. We often implement background colors using the reverse display-mode. This
"    makes life better when using cursorline: if ErrorMsg has fg=white bg=red,
"    then when you put a cursorline on it and it sets bg=similar2, error
"    messages now appear with white text and grey background. If instead
"    ErroMsg has bg=white fg=red reverse then the bg remains red the cursor is
"    over the message.
" 3. We use greys for thinsg like Comment and NonText, when the default
"    styling uses blues.
let s:specs = {}

" If the user has set g:base16_transparent_background then the normal group
" has no background color.

"   Error          fg=White bg=Red
"   Todo           fg=Blue bg=Yellow
" See |group-name| for details on what means what.
" We will follow this pattern with a few minor changes:
" 1. We'll use the reverse trick on ErrorMsg and TODO
" 2. TODO will be black-on-yellow, because blue-on-yellow is garish.
" To override these, see the discussion on g:base16_color_overrides below.
