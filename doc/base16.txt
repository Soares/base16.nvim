INTRODUCTION					*base16-intro*

A whole bunch of color schemes for neovim. They are pretty, configurable, and
work well with neovim's terminal emulator.

If |termguicolors| is set, these themes will Just Work, and they'll also set
up your neovim terminal emulator with a colorscheme to match.

If |termguicolors| is not set, then all these themes will fall back on the
host terminal's color scheme, you'll need to set that to the base16 theme you
want (using, e.g., the chriskempson/base16-shell repo on github). In that
case, the colors in the scheme will be ignored.  Once neovim issue #5668 is
fixed, this scheme will be able to offer the ability to change themes (from
within vim, without touching the terminal profile yourself) on the fly. Right
now, though, if you want to change themes on the fly, you need to

						*g:base16_hex_colors*
						*g:base16_cterm_colors*
The colors used are exposed by the dictionaries |g:base16_hex_colors| and
|g:base16_cterm_colors|.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					*base16-config*

						*g:base16_color_overrides*
A dictionary that changes which colors do what. For example, you might set
>
	let g:base16_color_overrides = {
		\ 'Todo': 'fg=purple bg=yellow bold',
		\ 'DiffAdd': 'bg=blue',
		\ 'DiffChange': 'bg=purple',
		\ 'DiffDelete': 'fg=blue bg=aqua bold',
		\ 'DiffText': 'bg=red bold',
		\ 'IncSearch': 'reverse'}
<
to make this theme more like the vim default theme. (This theme is almost
identical to the vim default theme, except that the above highlights are all
changed to better options. Seriously, who highlights diff add/delete anything
other than green/red?)

I personally use
>
	let b:base16_color_overrides = {'Comment': 'fg=similar1 italic'}
<
to get some nice inoffensive comment coloring.

The keys of the dictionary should be highlight groups. The values should be
a string of arguments for |:Base16Highlight|, described below. It will be
called with the [!] option.

We recommend that you do most of your highlighting via |:highlight link|
commands. This override should mainly be used to change the base theme. See
|group-name| for the names of the core groups; setting the colors of those ~10
groups is almost always all you need to do to get the behavior you want.

To tweak highlighting of the nvim interface (such as the color of matched
parenthesis, the color of incremental searches, etc.), see |highlight-groups|
for the names and descriptions of all the relevant groups.

						*g:base16_color_modifiers*
A dictionary of modifications to make to the color scheme after the default
colors have their run. For example, if you set
>
	let g:base16_color_modifiers = {'Comment': 'italic'}
<
then comments will be made italic in addition to whatever their default was
going to be.

Why do we provide all three of color_overrides, color_modifiers, and the
Base16Highlight command, you ask? In short, because there are lots of different
base16 color schemes, and we want you to be able to change between them on the
fly. If we didn't let you do make all your changes via global variables, then
you could run a bunch of :Base16Highlight commands in your init.vim after
:colorscheme, but then you'd need to re-run them every time you changed color
schemes, which would be quite annoying.

					*g:base16_transparent_background*
Set this to 1 if you don't want nvim painting a background (i.e., if you want
to use terminal transparency and/or terminal background images).


==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*base16-commands*

:Base16Highlight[!] group fg=... bg=... ...		*:Base16Highlight*
Highlight some things. Examples:
>
	:Base16Highlight Comment fg=green italic
	:Base16Highlight ErrorMsg bg=orange
<
The args may be fg=COLOR, bg=COLOR, or ATTR.  COLOR may be any of:

	black dark3 dark2 dark1 light1 light2 light3 white
	red orange yellow green aqua blue purple brown
	base similar3 similar2 similar1 contrast1 contrast2 contrast3 antibase
	bg background fg foreground

'background' and 'foreground' are special options that use the normal
background/foreground respectively. 'bg' and 'fg' are shorthand for those
special terms.

If |background|=dark, then 'base' is 'black', 'similar*' is 'dark*',
'contrast*' is 'light*', and 'antibase' is 'white'. If |background|=light, then
the direction is swapped ('base' is 'white', 'similar*' is 'light*', etc).

ATTR may be any of the attributes listed in |attr-list|.

If the command is given a bang, then other attributes are removed. Otherwise,
attributes are stacked. For example,
>
	:Base16Highlight! Comment fg=green
<
sets the foreground to green, the background to NONE, and the attrs to NONE,
whereas
>
	:Base16Highlight Comment fg=green
<
sets the foreground to green without affecting the foreground or background.
